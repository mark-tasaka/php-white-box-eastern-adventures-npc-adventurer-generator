# php-white-box-eastern-adventures-npc-adventurer-generator
The ‘White Box: Eastern Adventures’ Non-Player Character (NPC) Adventurer Generator is designed with PHP to randomly generate four NPC Adventurers.  The NPC Adventurers reflect the four character classes and the four species (humans, koropokuru, kitsune and tengu) available in the game.  Unique character sheets have been created for the four character classes, with unique attributes and abilities generated for the classes.  Seven drop down menus appear on the Launch Page, providing the user with options for customizing the NPC Adventurers generated.  POST methods are used to collect the data from the drop down menus, where the data is sent to npc_adventurers.php.  Wherever possible, external PHP files have been created to store related functions; thus, aiming to create a program with high cohesion and low coupling, an important principle of object-orientated design.
